## Diamonds

This project demonstrates the use of **Quarto** and **R** to generate reproducible reports. Using the `ggplot2` package, we visualize insights from the built-in **diamonds** dataset, which contains detailed characteristics of nearly 54,000 diamonds, including their carat, cut, color, clarity, and price.

The output includes both the **current system date and time** to ensure that every report reflects when it was generated, highlighting the reproducibility and dynamic nature of Quarto documents.

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Print current date and time
cat("Report generated on:", Sys.time(), "\n")

# Plot using diamonds dataset
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "Diamonds: Price vs Carat",
         subtitle = paste("Generated on", Sys.time()),
         x = "Carat",
         y = "Price")

```

```{r}

```
